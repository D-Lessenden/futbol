# Futbol

## Design
Our runner file accesses our stat_tracker file that houses all of the required methods. We abstracted our CSV reading methods into one class called CSVData. From there we were able to instantiate our game statistics, team statistics, league statistics, and season statistics and our CSV objects games, teams, and game teams are passed through. 

Our statistics methdods include a module named Calculatable where we have several methods that find average, identify a teamname when given a team identification number, among other features.
